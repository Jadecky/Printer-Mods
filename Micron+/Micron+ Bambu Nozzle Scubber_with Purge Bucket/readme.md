M3x6 BHCS are inserted into the base of the bucket, and attatch to magnets inserted into the base from the underside.

`base.stl` is based on my bed location, I use Boop Beta 4 on my Micron so your bed location may differ. 

To ensure this isn't an issue, here's a `base_no_chain.stl` that isn't extended past the chain to allow for different bed locations.
