Slightly modified mounts for the awesome Matchstick Diffusers by Maple Leaf Makers
(Original here)

Allows the matchsticks to be angled down towards the print area.

Can be mounted under the top 1515 extrusion (left and right in the image below), or on the front face of the extrusion (rear matchstick on the image below)

There's a slightly different mount, that's optional, but allows for easier mounting of the 45 degree clips.
