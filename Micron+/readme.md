# [Smol Hex Skirts](https://github.com/Jadecky/Printer-Mods/tree/main/Micron%2B/Smol%20Hex%20Skirts)

Whilst the Micron+ is an awesome little scaled down 2.4.. the skirt Hex's weren't scaled down enough and looked too big. These have Smaller Hex's

STLs aren't orientated correctly yet, Images to follow. 

# [Micron Z Belt Clamp](https://github.com/Jadecky/Printer_Mods/tree/main/Micron%2B/Micron%20Z%20Belt%20Clamp)

Belt clamps to allow you to keep a bit of extra Z belt nice & neat. 

Remixed from the original [Voron Variant](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/ChenTheDesignMaker/Z_Belt_Clip), by ChentheDesignMaker, to include a Micron Logo instead.

# [KGLM Hex Z-Joint](https://github.com/Jadecky/Printer_Mods/blob/main/Micron%2B/KGLM%20Hex%20Z%20Joint/Images/KGLM_Hex.png)

A slightly chonkier Z Joint to prevent cracking. Half hex shaped, rather than spherical. With Micron Logo or without.

(For the logo version, print the top layer slooooow)
