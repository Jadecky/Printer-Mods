'Remix' of the original [Bearing Repacker](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Misc_Designs/tree/master/Bearing_Repacker) from [Annex-Engineering](https://annex-engineering.eu) for the smaller F623 Bearings found in the Voron V0 and 3D Printers for Ants. 

Now has an M3 heatset, rather than a nut, to prevent unwanted hanfdling of grease covered, sticky nuts.

If using a flanged bearing, the flange should go against the printed part. (See first image)

Don't forget to remove and replace the seals before and after repacking withgrease.
